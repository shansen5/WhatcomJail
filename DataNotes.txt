Whatcom Jail Data Notes

1/1/2000 to 9/21/2017
select count(distinct(name)) from releases  => 42,072
select count(distinct(name)) from bookings  => 41,438

Before about 2014 the bookings have a Name ID field, while
releases show 0, so the name must be used for matching.

After the Name ID starts being used, the names don't always
match.  E.g. in releases 'CRITCHLOW, JOHN CRAGIN', but in
bookings 'CRITCHLOW JR, JOHN CRAGIN'.  Where there is a
non-zero Name ID, it is used for matching.

Workflow:
1.  ScrapeBookings.py 1/1/2000 10/26/2017 > bookings-2000-2017.csv
This records the data from the bookings web page from the start date to end 
date provided. The records are written to standard output so they need to be 
redirected into the CSV file.
2.  ScrapeReleases.py 1/1/2000 10/26/2017 > releases-2000-2017.csv
This follows the same process as for bookings above.
3.  readbookingscsv.py bookings-2000-2017.csv
This reads the bookings CSV file and inserts the records into a bookings table 
in the jail2.sqlite database.
    name_id
    name
    charges
    arrest_type
    bail
    booking_dt
    matched
4.  readreleasescsv.py releases-2000-2017.csv
This reads the releases CSV into a releases table.
    name_id
    name
    description
    release_dt
5.  computeperiods.py
This goes through each record in releases and looks in bookings for the most 
recent booking before the release.  When it is found it is written into a 
bookings_releases table.
    booking_row (rowid of the booking)
    release_row (rowid of the release)
  The duration fields is initially empty.
6.  nomatchingreleases.py 1/1/2014
Go through all bookings beginning with the from_date argument.  If there is
a matching release record, there should already be a record in 
bookings_releases for this booking/release pair, so do nothing.  If there
is not a matching release insert a new record in bookings_releases with the
booking_row and a null releases_row.  This may let us account for those who
have not been released and so should be added to the population for all days
after their booking date.  However it will also count those bad data cases
such as those released but with no release record, and those whose release
records have names or ids that do not match booking records.
7.  dailypopulation.py 1/1/2000 10/25/2017 
This uses the bookings_releases table to count the population for each day 
from the start to end dates.
8.  monthlypopulation.py 1 2000 9 2017 > monthlypopulation.csv
This uses the dailypopulation table to take an average of the daily population 
for each month between the start month and year to the end month and year.  It 
writes to standard output, so redirect to a CSV file to look at it in a 
spreadsheet.
9.  durations.py
Compute duration of jail stay from booking_row and release_row. Produces 
floating point fraction of days, which is stored in the duration field of the 
bookings_releases database table.
10. Booking and release tables merged  (bookings-releases-fullrecords.csv)
select b.name, b.charges, b.arrest_type, b.bail, b.booking_dt, r.release_dt from bookings b, releases r, bookings_releases br 
where b.rowid = br.booking_row and r.rowid = br.release_row
11. Total bail for each booking
    select count(*), b.name, b.booking_dt, sum( b.bail ), 
        julianday( r.release_dt ) - julianday( b.booking_dt ) 
    from bookings b, releases r, bookings_releases br
    where b.rowid = br.booking_row and r.rowid = br.release_row 
        and upper(r.description) like 'TIME SERVED%' group by b.booking_dt, b.name
Gives the number of counts in the booking for the person on that date, along with 
the total bail and the number of days served, when the person serves time rather than
posting bail.  From this we can get, based on the month of the booking
- average bail per booking per month
- average number of counts per booking per month
- average time served per booking per month

The release on 5/17/2001 gets associated with the bookings on 5/8.  There is no booking that
matches the 5/29/2001 release, and no release that matches the 2/7/2001 bookings.

The 2017-02-17 booking is later on the same day as a release.  Then there is another
release two days later.

A large number of bookings missing in late 2013 and 2014.  Example:
bookings:
11800010000000	BAILEY, CHARLIE STUART	DUI	IOO	0	2006-08-21 07:00
3013	BAILEY, CHARLIE STUART	DUI	DUIA	0	2014-09-03 10:03
releases:
0	    BAILEY, CHARLIE STUART	TIME SERVED ON SENTENCE	2006-08-23 07:00
3013	BAILEY, CHARLIE STUART	Bail or Bond	2013-11-25 17:05
3013	BAILEY, CHARLIE STUART	Time Served	2014-10-02 11:07
The 2013-11-25 release is missing its booking, so it mistakenly gets assigned
the 2006-08-11 booking which makes it look like he is in for several years.
As a booking is associated with a release it must be marked as used so later
releases for which bookings are missing get marked as missing.
